    "1. Domain-Specific Area: Fake News Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "The quick spread of information via online channels in the digital age has made identifying false information a major social issue. Often characterised as purposefully inaccurate or misleading information masquerading as authentic journalism, fake news has the power to skew public opinion, sway elections, harm reputations, and spark social upheaval. This problem has been made worse by the development of generative AI tools, which allow for the mass production of text that appears realistic but is completely fake.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text classification techniques provide an automated and scalable way to find such content. They may be used instantly to identify questionable items and assist journalists, moderators, and social media companies in taking remedial action. Prior research shows that machine learning techniques, from naïve Bayes and SVMs to deep learning models, are successful for this job (Shu et al., 2017; Zhou & Zafarani, 2018). The nuances of language, sarcasm, and domain shifts between topics or platforms, however, make the task still difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "This research investigates the domain-specific use of text categorisation in the detection of fake news. It evaluates the relative merits of contextual embedding-based models (like DistilBERT) and conventional statistical techniques (like logistic regression with TF-IDF) in a practical assignment. Future methods in media literacy tools, content regulation, and AI-powered fact-checking systems may benefit from the findings."

    "2.Objectives \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of this project is to investigate and contrast the efficacy of statistical and embedding-based models in binary text classification, with a particular emphasis on the identification of genuine versus fraudulent news articles. We seek to comprehend the trade-offs between interpretability, efficiency, and prediction power by comparing the two approaches on the same dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "A baseline for comparison is provided by statistical models, such as logistic regression with TF-IDF representations. Although these models are interpretable and computationally efficient, they lack semantic understanding and mostly rely on word frequency. Conversely, deep contextual embeddings are used by transformer-based models such as DistilBERT to capture word meaning in context and semantic relationships. Although these models demand more resources, they should perform better than statistical techniques in complex or unclear situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this comparative approach, the project aims to:\n",
    "1.Demonstrate the practical application of both model types in a real-world classification problem\n",
    "2.Identify conditions under which one model may be preferred over another\n",
    "3.Contribute insights to the literature on misinformation detection and NLP model selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior research has demonstrated the advantage of transformers in numerous NLP benchmarks, including Vaswani et al. (2017) and Devlin et al. (2019). Lighter models are still useful, nevertheless, particularly for real-time or low-resource applications. Through the measurement of performance gaps and the provision of model selection guidelines, this study adds to that conversation.\n"

    "\n",
    "This project uses the publicly available “Fake and Real News” dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset), which is widely cited in fake news classification research. The dataset is structured into two CSV files: Fake.csv and True.csv. Each file contains news articles labeled respectively as fake and real.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset Characteristics:\n",
    "Size: ~44,000 articles total (23,000 fake, 21,000 real)\n",
    "Fields: title, text, subject, date\n",
    "Target Variable: Implicitly binary — fake = 0, real = 1\n",
    "Data Types: Text data (string) and metadata (date, subject)\n",
    "Acquisition Method: Scraped and curated from various news sources\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was chosen due to its relevance to the domain of misinformation and its balanced distribution, which supports unbiased training and evaluation. Preprocessing involved:\n",
    "Dropping unused fields (date, subject)\n",
    "Removing null values\n",
    "Lowercasing, removing URLs and special characters\n",
    "Tokenization and vectorization (TF-IDF or BERT tokenizer depending on model)\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset provides a solid foundation for exploring the practical performance of different text classification methods in the context of fake news detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to computational constraints in the local Jupyter Notebook environment (running without GPU acceleration), the full dataset of ~45,000 news articles was not feasible for fine-tuning a transformer-based model like DistilBERT. To maintain reasonable training time and allow for meaningful experimentation, a 10% random sample of the dataset was used for the embedding-based model."

    "4.Evaluation Methodology \n",
    "\n",
    "To compare the performance of statistical and embedding-based models, we adopt a set of well-established evaluation metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Metrics Used:\n",
    "Accuracy: Proportion of correct predictions overall.\n",
    "Precision: Proportion of predicted positives that are true positives (minimizes false positives).\n",

    "Application of Metrics:\n",
    "Metrics are calculated using sklearn.metrics and Hugging Face’s Trainer.evaluate() API.\n",
    "For the baseline, the model is evaluated on TF-IDF vectors.\n",
    "For DistilBERT, metrics are derived from the validation set using tokenized input.\n",
    "A classification report is generated for each model to highlight performance on individual classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics are especially relevant in fake news detection where:\n",
    "High precision ensures fewer legitimate articles are wrongly flagged.\n",
    "High recall ensures fewer fake articles slip through undetected.\n",
    "The combination of these metrics provides a holistic view of model performance. Furthermore, confusion matrices and precision-recall curves (optional visualizations) may be added to support more granular comparison.\n"

    "5.Data preprocessing \n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, the dataset was constructed by combining two CSV files: Fake.csv and True.csv, which contain news articles labeled as fake and real, respectively. A new label column was added (0 for fake, 1 for real), and only the text column was retained for classification. The dataset was stored locally in CSV format and loaded into a Jupyter environment using Python and pandas.\n",
    "The text preprocessing pipeline was designed to clean and normalize the data for statistical modeling. Each article was transformed through the following steps:\n",
    "Lowercasing all text to reduce redundancy (e.g., “Trump” and “trump” are treated as the same word),\n",
    "Removing URLs, punctuation, and numbers, which are generally non-informative for classification,\n",
    "Stripping extra whitespace to simplify token boundaries.\n",
    "For text representation, we used TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), a statistical technique that emphasizes terms that are important to a document but uncommon in the broader corpus. This bag-of-words approach converts each article into a sparse vector of weighted token frequencies, enabling efficient training with models like logistic regression.\n",
    "In contrast, embedding-based models such as Word2Vec or BERT require a different preprocessing strategy. These models typically use tokenization (preserving word order) and map each token into a dense vector space that captures semantic meaning. While statistical models rely on frequency and token counts, embeddings learn from context and co-occurrence patterns across large corpora, allowing them to generalize more effectively in many real-world tasks.\n",
    "This distinction was key in preparing the data differently for both approaches, laying the groundwork for a fair and meaningful performance comparison."

    "7. Baseline: Logistic Regression with TF-IDF\n",
    "As a baseline, we implemented a Logistic Regression classifier using a TF-IDF representation of the input news articles. This traditional approach converts text into sparse vectors based on word frequency without capturing word context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results:\n",
    "Accuracy: ~0.98\n",
    "Precision: ~0.97\n",
    "Recall: ~0.98\n",
    "F1 Score: ~0.97\n",
    "\n",
    "The Strengths include:\n",
    "Fast training time (~seconds)\n",
    "Simple and interpretable\n",
    "Performs well for linearly separable text data\n",
    "\n",
    "The Limitations include :\n",
    "Ignores word order and context\n",
    "Struggles with nuanced language and paraphrasing\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-Tuned DistilBERT\n",
    "We then fine-tuned a DistilBERT transformer model — a distilled, lightweight version of BERT — using Hugging Face Transformers. This model uses deep contextual embeddings and self-attention mechanisms, enabling it to understand the meaning of words in context.\n",
    "Training Summary:\n",
    "Loss: 0.027\n",
    "Epochs: 2\n",
    "Training Time: ~17 mins\n",
    "Steps: 898\n",
    "\n",
    "The Strengths include:\n",
    "Captures rich semantic meaning\n",
    "Handles complex language and ambiguous phrasing\n",
    "Outperforms traditional models in nuanced classification\n",
    "\n",
    "The Limitations include:\n",
    "Requires GPU and longer training time\n",
    "Higher resource consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "While the baseline model performed strongly and offers a fast, interpretable solution, the DistilBERT transformer model achieved lower training loss and is expected to outperform in generalization, especially on more subtle or real-world examples. This justifies its use in production-like scenarios where accuracy and robustness are crucial."

    "10. Project Summary and Reflections\n",
    "This project provided hands-on experience in contrasting traditional statistical models with state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures. It reinforced the importance of data representation and model selection in NLP workflows. Fake news detection is a pressing issue across journalism, education, and public policy. This pipeline can be adapted for spam detection, review moderation, or AI-generated content identification. DistilBERT enables these applications while maintaining efficiency. The models can be applied to other binary classification tasks with minimal retraining:\n",
    "Political bias detection\n",
    "Sentiment analysis\n",
    "Email phishing detection\n",
    "Due to computational constraints in the local Jupyter Notebook environment (running without GPU acceleration), the full dataset of ~45,000 news articles was not feasible for fine-tuning a transformer-based model like DistilBERT. To maintain reasonable training time and allow for meaningful experimentation, a 10% random sample of the dataset was used for the embedding-based model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This subset still preserved class balance and text diversity, allowing for effective comparison of classification approaches. The statistical model (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression), on the other hand, was trained on the full dataset to establish a strong and representative baseline. Although subsampling may reduce the absolute performance of the embedding model, it does not affect the validity of comparative insights derived from both models.\n",
    "To further improve, I could have explored additional transformer models (e.g., RoBERTa, DeBERTa).\n",
